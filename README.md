# Data-Mining_Topic-Modeling
The goal of this project is to train machine learning systems to determine the accuracy of factual assertions online and justify those assessments with sentences extracted from Wikipedia. The Training dataset consists of 185,445 claims generated by altering sentences extracted from Wikipedia. The claims are classified as Supported, Refuted, or NotEnoughInfo. There are several wiki docs to be used as evidence for the claims. This project will help improve the ability to identify false information coming from unreliable sources on the web and social media. We have extracted top three feature using LDA on the training dataset and visualize the top 30 relevant topics on the dataset using pyLDAvis library . We have performed Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to extract features from the training set and wikis pages with the accuracy of 45% and 57% respectively. We believe that FEVER is a promising testbed that will help stimulate progress on claim verification against textual sources.
